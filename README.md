**#Used Car Price Prediction**

This project focuses on predicting the price of used cars in the United States based on various factors such as the year of purchase, mileage, location (city and state), make (manufacturer), and model. The ability to accurately predict used car prices is valuable for both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions. Additionally, it can assist manufacturers in estimating the resale value of their cars.

**Data Source**
The dataset used for this project comprises around 850,000 listings of used cars in the United States. This extensive dataset was collected from various sources, including online classifieds platforms, dealership websites, and car online auctions. It includes crucial details about each car, such as price, year of purchase, mileage, city, state, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), make, and model. With 852,122 records and a file size of 17.6 MB, this dataset provides a rich resource for analyzing trends and patterns in the US used car market and building predictive models for estimating car prices based on their features. You can access the dataset here.

**Research Question**
The primary research question addressed in this project is: Can we predict the price of a used car in the United States based on the year it was purchased, the number of kilometers it has been driven, the city and state in which it was purchased, the manufacturer, and its model name? To answer this question, we employ a combination of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and high-performance computing techniques.

**Contents**
**Data Preparation and Cleaning:** This section covers data quality assessment, cleaning procedures, handling duplicates, addressing outliers, and data reduction for exploratory analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** We perform both numerical and graphical analyses to understand the data better. This includes summary statistics, correlation analysis, ANOVA tests, scatter plots, geographic distribution, car makes and models, box plots, cluster analysis, data transformation, and handling outliers.

**Machine Learning Prediction:** Here, we delve into machine learning techniques for predicting used car prices. We use packages like Kernlab and Caret and train models like Support Vector Regression (SVM) and Linear Regression. We also visualize feature importance.

**High-Performance Computational Implementation:** This section explores high-performance computing techniques for efficient data pre-processing and modeling using SVM and Linear Regression.

**Performance Evaluation and Comparison of Methods:** We evaluate the performance of our models using various metrics and compare the results of Support Vector Regression and Linear Regression.

**Conclusion**
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the US used car market, aiming to predict used car prices accurately. The combination of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques allows us to address the research question effectively. Whether you're a used car buyer, seller, or manufacturer, the insights gained from this project can aid in making informed decisions and estimating car prices more accurately.
